# Privacy Policy (v0.5.0)
# -----------------------
# 1. ALL data stays local - nothing is ever uploaded to any server
# 2. No telemetry, no tracking, no external API calls
# 3. Models are trained 100% offline on your machine
# 4. Command history encrypted at rest (optional, see below)
# 5. You can clear all data at any time with: daedelus clear --all
# 6. Privacy patterns automatically filter sensitive data
# 7. Built-in privacy manager redacts credentials before logging
# 8. 100% FOSS - auditable, transparent, trustworthy

# Data Storage Locations
# ----------------------
# All data is stored locally in:
# - ~/.local/share/daedelus/    (or $XDG_DATA_HOME/daedelus/)
#   - history.db           (command history - filterable)
#   - embeddings.ann       (vector search index)
#   - models/              (LLM models - optional)
#   - adapters/            (LoRA fine-tuned adapters)
#   - daemon.log           (daemon logs)
#   - daemon.pid           (process ID)
#   - daemon.sock          (IPC socket)
# 
# To completely remove all data:
# rm -rf ~/.local/share/daedelus
# rm -rf ~/.config/daedelus

# Additional Security Options
# ---------------------------
# Consider setting these environment variables for enhanced privacy:
#
# export DAEDELUS_ENCRYPTION=1        # Enable command history encryption (AES-256)
# export DAEDELUS_NO_NETWORK=1        # Disable all network features (already off by default)
# export DAEDELUS_PARANOID_MODE=1     # Maximum privacy (logs nothing, no history)
# export DAEDELUS_FILTER_ALL=1        # Filter all commands through privacy manager
# export DAEDELUS_REDACT_PATHS=1      # Redact all file paths in logs

# New Features (v0.5.0)
# ---------------------
# - Real-time syntax highlighting (no data sent anywhere)
# - Multi-language script generation (all processed locally)
# - File operations with automatic backup (local only)
# - AI intent classification (processed on-device)
# - Template library (pre-built, no external calls)

# Privacy Manager Features

# Built-in automatic detection and redaction of:
# - AWS Access Keys (AKIA*)
# - API Tokens (various formats)
# - Email addresses (optional)
# - Credit card numbers
# - Social Security Numbers
# - Phone numbers
# - IP addresses (optional)
# - File paths (optional)
